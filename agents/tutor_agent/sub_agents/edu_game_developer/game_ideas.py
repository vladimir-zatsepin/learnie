    ## Memory Tiles Arcade

    Description:
    Memory Tiles Arcade is a fast-paced memory game emphasizing short-term recall. Tiles quickly appear and disappear, challenging players to remember pairs or concept matches based on the learning material.
    
    Gameplay & Rules:
	- Initially, tiles are briefly displayed face-up, each labeled with a concept, term, image, or definition.
	- Tiles flip face-down, and the player must rapidly uncover matching pairs (e.g., a concept and its definition, term and its associated image, mathematical equation and its solution, historical date and event).
	- Each round is timed, and speed and accuracy determine the playerâ€™s score.

    ## Match Attack (Matching Game)
    
    Description:
    Match Attack is an arcade-inspired, falling-items matching game. It challenges players to quickly categorize terms or concepts learned from the reading material, reinforcing active recall and fast recognition skills.
    
    Gameplay & Rules:
    - Terms (words or short phrases from educational content) fall from the top of the screen at increasing speeds.
    - At the bottom, there are labeled buckets/categories representing different groups learned in the reading material (e.g., historical periods, chemical elements, word categories, math formulas, etc.).
    - Players control a sliding catcher to quickly catch each falling term and release it into the correct category bucket.
    - Missing an item or placing it in an incorrect bucket results in lost points or missed combo opportunities.
    
    How Educational Material Is Applied:
    - Terms and categories directly reflect key points from recently read texts.
    - This encourages fast recognition and immediate categorization, reinforcing memorization through repetition and rapid categorization.
